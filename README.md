# Bkgreve's Emacs Configuration

This repository contains all my Emacs configuration files. This configuration
was created in Emacs 27.0.90 (built from source in Debian 10).

## Setup

Clone this repository into your home directory:
```sh
git@github.com:bkgreve/.emacs.d.git
```

## Packages

After cloning the repository, the following packages need to be installed:
* markdown-mode
* prettier-js
* tide
* flycheck
* elpy
* moe-theme
* powerline
* helm

## TODOs

Things I still want to implement:
* Some sort of package management to automate installing the above packages
* Automatically finding the `node_modules` directory when working on JS projects
* Any modifications needed to also make this configuration Mac OS friendly
